1. Description of Service

2. User Responsibilities

API Key: You are solely responsible for obtaining and providing a valid Google Gemini API key. You are responsible for any costs associated with your use of the Google Gemini API, as determined by Google's pricing and terms.
Compliance: You agree to use the Extension in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as the terms of service of the Google Gemini API (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms).
Content: You are responsible for the content of the webpages you choose to summarize and ensuring you have the right to process that content.
3. Intellectual Property

The Extension and its original content (excluding summaries generated by the Google Gemini API), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of xbcq.

6. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Extension immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.   

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
